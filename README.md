Features:

Randomize music.
  Left click the minimap button to change music.
  Use /avoid MusicID if you find something annoying and never want it to repeat. 
  Songs will not repeat until after your session has ended (ideally).

Disable Talking Heads
  Able to disable only in dungeons or everywhere.

Auto Disable Dialogue
  Automatically turn off Dialogue Audio after going into a dungeon for the first time.  This can be nice if you're repeating dungeons.
  The addon only stores you've done a dungeon after installation and cannot detect previous runs.
  Dialogue will automatically re-enable after leaving dungeons, or just use whatever your previous setting was if it was already disabled and you haven't changed this setting.

If you have any suggestions, bugs, or reports for annoying/short music with ID please report on GitHub!
